# Claude Code Project Setup

## Version Control
* Whenever code changes are made, you must record a one-line description with emoji in korean of the change in `.commit_message.txt` with Edit Tool.
   - Read `.commit_message.txt` first, and then Edit.
   - Overwrite regardless of existing content.
   - If it was a git revert related operation, make the .commit_message.txt file empty.
